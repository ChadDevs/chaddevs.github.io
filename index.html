    <h2 class="sunset"><u> Backstory</u></h2>
    <p class="mist">
      <span class="tab"></span>Monkey is a common name that may refer to mosts
      mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians.
      Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted
      as monkeys except the apes, a grouping known as paraphyletic; however in
      the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also
      included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regards to
      their scope.
    </p>
    <h2 class="sunset"><u>History</u></h2>
    <p class="mist">
      <span class="tab"></span>In 1812, Geoffroy grouped the apes and the
      Cercopithecidae group of monkeys together and established the name
      Catarrhini, "Old World monkeys", ("singes de l'Ancien Monde" in
      French).The extant sister of the Catarrhini in the monkey ("singes") group
      is the Platyrrhini (New World monkeys). Some nine million years before the
      bifurcation between the Cercopithecidae and the apes, the Platyrrhini
      emerged within "monkeys" by migration to South America from Afro-Arabia
      (the Old World), likely by ocean. The apes are thus deep in the tree of
      extant and extinct monkeys, and apes are distinctly closer related to the
      Cercopithecidae than the Platyrrhini are.
    </p>
    <h2 class="sunset"><u>Species</u></h2>
    <p class="mist">
      <span class="tab"></span> Within suborder Haplorhini, the simians are a
      sister group to the tarsiers, the two members bifurcated some 60 million
      years ago. New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the
      simians roughly 35 million years ago. Old World monkeys and apes emerged
      within the catarrhine monkeys about 25 million years ago. Extinct basal
      simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus (35, 32 million years ago)
      are also considered monkeys by primatologists. <br /><br />
      <span class="tab"></span> Lemurs, lorises, and galagos are not monkeys;
      instead they are strepsirrhine primates (suborder Strepsirrhini). The
      simians' sister group, the tarsiers, are also haplorhine primates;
      however, they are also not monkeys. <br /><br />
      <span class="tab"></span> Apes emerged within "monkeys" as sister of the
      Cercopithecidae in the Catarrhini, so cladistically they are monkeys as
      well. There has been resistance to directly designate apes (and thus
      humans) as monkeys, so "Old World monkey" may be taken to mean either the
      Cercopithecoidea (not including apes) or the Catarrhini (including
      apes)That apes are monkeys was already realized by Georges-Louis Leclerc,
      Comte de Buffon in the 18th century. Linnaeus placed this group in 1758
      together with the tarsiers, in a single genus "Simia" (sans Homo), an
      ensemble now recognised as the Haplorhini. <br /><br />
      <span class="tab"></span> Monkeys, including apes, can be distinguished
      from other primates by having only two pectoral nipples, a pendulous
      penis, and a lack of sensory whiskers.
